## Mark

1. Mark location of webbing on outside of lower panel (A).
1. Mark locations of bar tacks on outside of lower panel (A).
1. Mark location of buckle attachment on outside of lower panel (A).

## Pocket prep

The construction of the rear zipper pocket is similar to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYWDujbNWpo). At the end you should have a panel the same size as the lower rear of the bag, with a zipper across it.

1. Sew left and right pocket sides (J and K) to zipper: 
- Fold and press or tape the 1/4" seam allowance under, then stitch on top of the left and right ends of the zipper.

1. Sew pocket upper (I) to zipper.
- Fold and press or tape the 1/2" seam allowance under, then stitch in place along the top edge of the zipper. 
- The upper panel will overlap the left and right panels.
- Stitch as close as possible for the first stitch, then stitch a parallel line another 1/4" away from the zipper for reinforcement.

1. Sew pocket lower (H) to zipper.

1. There will be extra material sticking out on each side (J and K). Trim sides to straight lines.

1. Sew 1/2" grosgrain onto top edges of inner side pockets (L, M).

## Webbing

1. Cut 3/4" webbing for bottom, leaving some overlap on each side.
1. By hand or by machine, baste the webbing lengthwise onto the outside of the base. This will keep it aligned while you work on the bar tacks.
1. Bar tack at the marked locations, then trim all threads and remove the lengthwise basting stitches.

## Liner

1. Sew liner sides to liner main panel.
1. Reinforce seams on  liner with 1/2" grosgrain.
1. Fold over 1/4" seam allowance for pocket, then attach pocket bottom to lower back. Topstitch. Fold pocket up to match lower back.

## Lower outer
1. Sew lower sides to lower main panel.
1. Press seams toward sides and topstitch.
1. Optional: If you have foam or another stiffener for the lower, insert and attach it.

## Lower
1. Turn liner and lower right side out. Align the top edges and stitch together.

## Upper

1. Stitch uppers together with right sides together.
1. Sew 1/2" grosgrain onto just-finished seams.
1. Topstitch the seams, pressing toward long sides (front and back). Note that this is the opposite of the direction used on the lower. This is to reduce bulk when sewing them together.
1. Apply grosgrain in an accent color along the top edge. Use either 1/2" or 3/4".

## Velcro and pull tabs

1. Mark the centers of the front and back top edges of the upper.
1. Stitch 3" of velcro to the inside of the top edge, just below the grosgrain, centered at the marked location. Optional: Fold a 3" piece of grosgrain in half and sew in under the center of each piece of velcro, sticking up, for use as a pull tab.

## Upper + lower
1. Sew upper to lower, inserting the adjustable buckle's strap into the seam at the center back.
1. Reinforce the attachment for the buckle strap.

## Finishing

1. Sew 1/2" grosgrain onto the seam.
1. Optional: Press the upper-to-lower seam toward the base and topstitch.
1. Press folds into the top sides.
