## Cut

1. Cut all parts (A through K) from the main fabric. Here is a cutting layout for use on 1 yard of 60" fabric.
![Cutting layout](images/pink_overview.png)
1. Cut lower panel (A) and lower sides (F, G) from liner fabric.
1. Cut two copies of the inner side pocket (L, M) from inner pocket fabric.

## Mark

![Hardware positions on lower panel](images/base_panel_webbing.svg)

1. Mark location of webbing (horizontal bars) on outside of lower panel (A).
    * Mark as horizontal lines at 6.75" and 13.5" inches from the base. They should be symmetrical vertically.
1. Mark locations of bar tacks (vertical bars) on outside of lower panel (A).
    * The first and last bar tacks are 1.25" from the edge. The spacing between bar tacks is 1.5".
    * Mark as a vertical line that extends above and below the webbing line, so that you can see when the webbing is in place.
1. Mark location of buckle attachment (X in a square) on outside of lower panel (A).
    * The buckle is attached with a 1" square of stitching, placed 0.5" from the upper edge and 6.75" from the right or left edge (centered).

## Webbing

1. Cut two 15.5" long strips of 3/4" webbing.
1. By hand or by machine, baste the webbing lengthwise onto the outside of the base. This will keep it aligned while you work on the bar tacks.
1. Bar tack at the marked locations, then trim all threads and remove the lengthwise basting stitches.
    * To make a bar tack, set your machine to a zigzag switch and set the stitch length to a very small setting.
    * Practice on scrap to make sure your settings are correct.
    * You may need to turn down your thread tension or presser foot pressure.

## Buckle

1. Find the fixed (non-adjustable) side of your buckle. If your buckle is adjustable on both sides, just pick a side.
1. Cut a 4" long piece of 1" webbing. Singe the ends with a lighter to seal them.
1. Feed the strap through your webbing and double it back so that the ends match.
1. Place the strap ends on the X you marked on the outside of the lower front. The strap ends should be toward the bottom, and the buckle should be hanging over the edge of the fabric.
1. Stitch in a square, then add two diagonals to form the X. Remember to backstitch at the beginning and end.

## Inner pocket prep

1. Sew 1/2" grosgrain onto top (long) edges of inner side pockets (L, M).
1. Place one inner pocket panel on top of one liner side panel, with both right sides facing you. Align them on the lower edge.
1. Stitch around the sides and bottom of the pocket with a 1/4" seam allowance.

## Zipper pocket prep

The construction of the rear zipper pocket is similar to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYWDujbNWpo). At the end you should have a panel the same size as the lower rear of the bag, with a zipper across it.

1. Sew left and right pocket sides (J and K) to zipper: 
    * Fold and press or tape the 1/4" seam allowance under, then stitch on top of the left and right ends of the zipper.
![Zipper construction: left and right sides](images/zipper_construction_1.svg)
1. Sew pocket upper (I) to zipper.
    * Fold and press or tape the 1/2" seam allowance under, then stitch in place along the top edge of the zipper. 
    * The upper panel will overlap the left and right panels.
    * Stitch as close as possible for the first stitch, then stitch a parallel line another 1/4" away from the zipper for reinforcement.
![Zipper construction: upper](images/zipper_construction_2.svg)
1. Sew pocket lower (H) to zipper in the same way.
![Zipper construction: lower](images/zipper_construction_3.svg)
1. There will be extra material sticking out on each side (J and K). Trim sides to straight lines.

## Zipper pocket installation

1. Place zipper pocket panel on the lower panel, right sides together. Stitch with a 1/4" seam allowance. In this image the darker rectangle is the wrong side of the zipper pocket panel.
![Zipper pocket placement](images/attach_zipper_pocket.svg)
1. Fold zipper pocket panel at seam to match lower back. Topstitch.
![Zipper pocket topstitching](images/attach_zipper_pocket_2.svg)

## Lower outer
1. Lay out the lower main panel (A), right side up. Place the lower left side panel (F) on top, right side down. Align the top right corners.
![Alignment of lower side panel on base](images/align_lower_side_panel.svg)
1. Stitch along the right edge with a 1/4" seam allowance, stopping 1/4" from the edge of panel F.
1. Fold panel A so that the two dotted lines match and stitch on the dotted line, forming a corner.
    * Check out this boxed corner [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THtU74h0IZY) for a visualization.
![Folding base to match bottom edge of lower side panel](images/attach_lower_side_panel.svg)
    * The result will look like this:
![Finished fold and stitch](images/attach_lower_side_3d.svg)
1. Repeat the fold to create the next corner, attaching panel A to the third side of panel F. Panel A should now form a U shape with two sharp corners, like this:
![Base panel fully sewn to one side panel](images/attach_lower_side_3d_completed.svg)
1. Press seams toward side panels and topstitch.
    * Note: Pressing the seams in the opposite directions for the lower and upper portions of the bag will reduce the bulk when sewing upper and lower together.
1. Repeat previous four steps for to attach lower right panel (G) to lower main panel (A).
1. Optional: If you have foam or another stiffener for the lower, attach it.

## Liner

1. Sew liner sides to liner main panel, following the steps you used for the outer.
1. Reinforce seams on  liner with 1/2" grosgrain.

## Lower + liner
1. Turn lower right side out. Place the liner into the lower with the wrong sides together, align the top edges and stitch together.
    * All of your raw edges should now be hidden, except for the top edge.
    
## Upper

1. Place upper right side panel (D) and upper rear panel (B) with right sides together. Align on the right edge, with the top of the bag away from you.
![Upper right and rear panel alignment](images/attach_upper_right_rear.svg)
1. Stitch along right edge with a 1/4" seam allowance.
1. Repeat to attach the upper front panel (C) and upper left side panel (E). The result will be a tube of fabric with four vertical seams.
1. Sew 1/2" grosgrain onto just-finished seams.
    * Optional: Use an accent color for the grosgrain, which will be visible in the finished product.
1. Press the seams toward the front and rear panels and topstitch.
    * Note that this is the opposite of the direction used on the lower. This is to reduce bulk when sewing them together.
1. Apply grosgrain in an accent color along the top edge. Use either 1/2" or 3/4".

## Velcro and pull tabs

1. On the wrong sides, mark the centers of the front and back top edges of the upper.
1. Fold a 3" piece of grosgrain in half and pin or tape it to the upper at the center point to form a pull tab. The loose ends will be sewn in under the velcro.
1. Stitch 3" of velcro to the inside of the top edge, just below the grosgrain, centered at the marked location. The left edge will be 5.5" from the left side of the panel.
    * Stitch the velcro either with multiple lines of stitches or a box X pattern.
![Positioning information for velcro and pull tab](images/attach_upper_velcro.svg)

## Upper + lower

1. Turn upper inside out and place it around the lower, right sides together. Align the lower edge of the bag's upper and the upper edge of the bag's lower.
1. Cut a 15" length of 1" wide webbing for the adjustable side of the buckle strap.
1. Pin or tape the strap between the upper and lower fabric, at the center back. Leave a small tail sticking through the seam. You will trim this later.
1. Sew upper to lower with a 1/4" seam allowance.
1. Reinforce the attachment for the buckle strap by stitching it again within the seam allowance, then trim the buckle strap.

## Finishing

1. Sew 1/2" grosgrain onto the upper-to-lower seam.
1. Optional: Press the upper-to-lower seam toward the base and topstitch.
1. Thread the adjustable side of the buckle onto the strap and trim to length.
1. Press folds into the top sides with an iron (sythetic setting) or books (pile them on and leave it for a while) to make the roll top fold in at the sides like a sandwich bag.
