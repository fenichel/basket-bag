## Cut

1. Cut all parts (A through K) from the main fabric. Here is a cutting layout for use on 1 yard of 60" fabric.
![Cutting layout](images/pink_overview.png)
1. Cut lower panel (A) and lower sides (F, G) from liner fabric.
1. Cut two copies of the inner side pocket (L, M) from pocket fabric.

## Mark

![Hardware positions on lower panel](images/base_panel_webbing.svg)

1. Mark location of webbing (horizontal bars) on outside of lower panel (A).
    * Mark as horizontal lines at 6.75" and 13.5" inches from the base. They should be symmetrical vertically.
1. Mark locations of bar tacks (vertical bars) on outside of lower panel (A).
    * The first and last bar tacks are 1.25" from the edge. The spacing between bar tacks is 1.5".
    * Mark as a vertical line that extends above and below the webbing line, so that you can see when the webbing is in place.
1. Mark location of buckle attachment (X in a square) on outside of lower panel (A).
    * The buckle is attached with a 1" square of stitching, placed 0.5" from the upper edge and 6.75" from the right or left edge (centered).

## Webbing

1. Cut two 15.5" long strips of 3/4" webbing.
1. By hand or by machine, baste the webbing lengthwise onto the outside of the base. This will keep it aligned while you work on the bar tacks.
1. Bar tack at the marked locations, then trim all threads and remove the lengthwise basting stitches.
    * To make a bar tack, set your machine to a zigzag switch and set the stitch length to a very small setting.
    * Practice on scrap to make sure your settings are correct.
    * You may need to turn down your thread tension or presser foot pressure.

## Buckle

1. Find the fixed (non-adjustable) side of your buckle. If your buckle is adjustable on both sides, just pick a side.
1. Cut a 4" long piece of 1" webbing. Singe the ends with a lighter to seal them.
1. Feed the strap through your webbing and double it back so that the ends match.
1. Place the strap ends on the X you marked on the outside of the lower front. The strap ends should be toward the bottom, and the buckle should be hanging over the edge of the fabric.

1. Stitch in a square, then add two diagonals to form the X. Remember to backstitch at the beginning and end.

## Inner pocket prep

1. Sew 1/2" grosgrain onto top (long) edges of inner side pockets (L, M).

## Zipper pocket prep

The construction of the rear zipper pocket is similar to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYWDujbNWpo). At the end you should have a panel the same size as the lower rear of the bag, with a zipper across it.

1. Sew left and right pocket sides (J and K) to zipper: 
    * Fold and press or tape the 1/4" seam allowance under, then stitch on top of the left and right ends of the zipper.

1. Sew pocket upper (I) to zipper.
    * Fold and press or tape the 1/2" seam allowance under, then stitch in place along the top edge of the zipper. 
    * The upper panel will overlap the left and right panels.
    * Stitch as close as possible for the first stitch, then stitch a parallel line another 1/4" away from the zipper for reinforcement.

1. Sew pocket lower (H) to zipper in the same way.
![Zipper construction: lower](images/zipper_construction_3.svg)
1. There will be extra material sticking out on each side (J and K). Trim sides to straight lines.

## Zipper pocket installation

1. Place zipper pocket panel on the lower panel, right sides together. Stich with a 1/4" seam allowance.
![Zipper pocket placement](images/attach_zipper_pocket.svg)
1. Fold zipper pocket panel at seam to match lower back. Topstitch.

## Liner

1. Sew liner sides to liner main panel.
1. Reinforce seams on  liner with 1/2" grosgrain.

## Lower outer
1. Sew lower sides to lower main panel.
1. Press seams toward sides and topstitch.
1. Optional: If you have foam or another stiffener for the lower, insert and attach it.

## Lower
1. Turn liner and lower right side out. Align the top edges and stitch together.

## Upper

1. Stitch uppers together with right sides together.
1. Sew 1/2" grosgrain onto just-finished seams.
1. Topstitch the seams, pressing toward long sides (front and back). Note that this is the opposite of the direction used on the lower. This is to reduce bulk when sewing them together.
1. Apply grosgrain in an accent color along the top edge. Use either 1/2" or 3/4".

## Velcro and pull tabs

1. Mark the centers of the front and back top edges of the upper.
1. Stitch 3" of velcro to the inside of the top edge, just below the grosgrain, centered at the marked location. Optional: Fold a 3" piece of grosgrain in half and sew in under the center of each piece of velcro, sticking up, for use as a pull tab.

## Upper + lower
1. Sew upper to lower, inserting the adjustable buckle's strap into the seam at the center back.
1. Reinforce the attachment for the buckle strap.

## Finishing

1. Sew 1/2" grosgrain onto the seam.
1. Optional: Press the upper-to-lower seam toward the base and topstitch.
1. Press folds into the top sides.
