## Fabric selection

Note: Cordura is a brand name for a type of nylon. Denier refers to the weight of the fabric, with a higher denier fabric being heavier.

### Outer lower

I used [400D packcloth nylon](https://www.seattlefabrics.com/60-400-D-Packcloth-Nylon-895--1050-linear-yard_p_48.html) for a lighter version of this bag. For a heavier version I used [1000D cordura](https://www.seattlefabrics.com/60-1000-D-Cordura-Nylon-1350-linear-yard_p_53.html), which made the bag stand up better when empty.

If you live somewhere with weather, pick a waterproof or water-resistant fabric for the outer.

### Outer upper

The upper portion of the bag forms the rolltop section. I used the same material for the upper and lower, but you could use a lighter material to make it easier to roll. 

### Liner

The liner will be a second layer of fabric on the inside of the lower half of the bag. This fabric doesn't need to be able to stand up on its own, as it will be supported by the bag. I used ripstop to make it hold up to tools and sharp things bouncing around. I suggest using a light color, to make it easier to see the contents of the bag.

I used [this diamond ripstop](https://www.seattlefabrics.com/60-400-x-300-D-NylonPolyester-Diamond-Ripstop-1095-linear-yard_p_47.html) in white.

### Inner pockets

This design has two optional pockets along the inner sides of the lower (boxy) section. You could use almost any fabric for this. If you're not sure, just use the same material as your liner. Mesh is also a good choice, but trickier to sew.

## Presser feet

You can sew this entire pattern with a standard presser foot on your machine, but there are several specialized presser feet that make sewing easier and faster.

- A [zipper foot ](https://sewguide.com/sewing-machine-feet-guide/#3_zipper_footpiping_foot) for attaching zippers.
- A [quilting foot](https://sewguide.com/sewing-machine-feet-guide/#9_quilting_foot) for sewing 1/4" seam allowances.
- A [bias binding foot](https://sewguide.com/sewing-machine-feet-guide/#25_bias_tape_binder_foot) for applying grosgrain ribbon.
- An [edge joining foot](https://sewguide.com/sewing-machine-feet-guide/#17_edge_joining_foot) for edgestitching.
